I am learning how to use the command line, and brushin up on my html skills via the odin project. To get here I had to create a repo in 
Github.com then clone it to my Macbook. Once it was on my Macbook, I moved the the folder from my Home directory to my repos folder, and 
created this README file, and now I'm currently editing it from the terminal using the nano command. Now on to the html portion of the 
assignment...
